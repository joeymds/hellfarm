## Milestone 1: Trustworthy Level-Up Loop

### ✅ Story 1.1: Implement Rake Damage Upgrade (Completed: 19 April 2026)

**Goal:** Make "Rake Damage" upgrade functional with 15% damage increase per selection.

**Changes:**
- Modified [Code/Controllers/SwordAbilityController.cs](Code/Controllers/SwordAbilityController.cs)
  - Added `baseDamage` field to track original damage value
  - Initialized `baseDamage` from exported `Damage` property in `_Ready()`
  - Updated `OnAbilityUpgradeAdded()` to handle "rake_damage" upgrade ID
  - Implemented additive damage scaling: `baseDamage * (1 + damageIncrease)` where increase = quantity × 0.15
  - Added debug logging for rake damage calculations
  - Preserved existing `sword_rate` behavior

**Acceptance Criteria Verified:**
- ✅ Selecting "Rake Damage" increases rake damage from 5.0 to 5.75 (15%)
- ✅ Multiple selections stack correctly (2x = 6.5 damage, 30% increase)
- ✅ Damage increase visible in floating damage text
- ✅ Build succeeds with no new errors
- ✅ Sword rate upgrade still works independently

**Build Status:** ✅ Success
